# Unscrambling Image Project

## Overview
This project focuses on solving the challenging problem of unscrambling scrambled images. It involves generating datasets of scrambled images, designing deep learning models to reconstruct their original order, and evaluating the performance of these models.

## Key Features
1. **Image Scrambling and Dataset Generation**:
   - A 4x4 block scramble method is used to create datasets of scrambled images and their labels.
   - Generated a dataset of 5,000 scrambled images with corresponding labels for training and evaluation.

2. **Deep Learning Approach**:
   - Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the correct order of image blocks.
   - Explored different strategies for representing outputs, including direct pixel rearrangement and label prediction.

3. **Visualization and Debugging**:
   - Provided visual representations of the scrambling and unscrambling process for better understanding and debugging.

4. **Programming and Libraries**:
   - Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, PyTorch, and Matplotlib for image processing, dataset creation, and model training.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Computer Vision**: Applied techniques to preprocess images and create shuffled datasets.
